Clockheart!

An interactive game created with a Javascript/React frontend and a Java spring backend. <br>
Using react three/drei, react-flipbook + react-elastic-carousel

To play:

Clone the repo, npm install all the depencies for react and then npm start to run the front end.
If you have problems npm installing the react-pageflip dependency then paste ' npm install react-pageflip ' into your terminal to install just that one.
The backend server is held in Java spring so you'll need to run the application to play the game.

Once started it should look like this:

You'll walk through the street level, getting shouted at by the locals until you get to the door of the tavern where you'll be asked to create a character. You can give a name and pick a class.
like this:

Once your character is created you'll be taken in to the tavern. Inside the tavern you can buy/sell items at the keeper (Zeb) who you'll find behind the bar.

After the shop you can visit the quest giver in a room at the top left of the tavern and pick a quest to complete.
